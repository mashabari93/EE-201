## Why I'm Taking This Class
I'm mostly taking this class for fun because as an employee I get 6 free credits. I would also (eventually) like to pursue a master's or phd in Electrical Engineering and think this class would be helpful for the future. I took digital electronics in high school where we learned circuit making and really enjoyed it so I think I will enjoy this class as well. 

## Fun Facts About Me
1) I really enjoy learning different languages. I am fluent in Russian and have been learning German since high school. I also recently started learning Tamil. 
2) I have a cat named toothless who actually has no teeth. Here is a picture:
